Using SQL commands we received some summery statistics, found outliers.

Then after average population and area were found we discovered 7 densely populated countries.
They were identified as having the area below the average and the population above the average.

The list was following:

- Bangladesh

- Germany

- Japan	

- Philippines

- Thailand

- United Kingdom	

- Vietnam




Here are some next steps for us to explore:

Which countries have the highest ratios of water to land? Which countries have more water than land?
Which countries will add the most people to their population next year?
Which countries have a higher death rate than birth rate?
