This project is about Hacker News investigation.

What kind of posts are most popular? Which of them are getting more comments?
From the point of author's view, what time is more favorable for posting a new article?


By doing some quick and easy steps, we received the following:

On average, Ask HN posts are more popular - they tend to receive more comments.
Moreover, we got the top 5 hours during the day when posts on average receive the biggest number of comments. 
If we convert this time to the time zone of Minsk, the most suitable time for posting an Ask Post would be 23:00, 10:00, 4:00, 5:00 or midnight.

Here are some next steps to consider:

- Determine if show or ask posts receive more points on average.

- Determine if posts created at a certain time are more likely to receive more points.

- Compare results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive.
